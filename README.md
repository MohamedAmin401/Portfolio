### Work Experience
Machine Learning Engineer (Academic & Research Projects)
Helwan University

Designed and implemented end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipelines for real-world datasets.

Worked extensively with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, and data science libraries.

Applied CNNs, Transformers, and optimization algorithms to vision, NLP, and EEG-based problems.

Focused on model evaluation, overfitting reduction, and performance comparison using multiple metrics.
### Projects
EEG to Text (Graduation Project)

Built a CNN + Transformer + BART-based architecture to decode EEG signals into text.

Implemented custom modules including EEG CNN backbone, adapters, sinusoidal positional embeddings, and semantic matching loss.

Explored alternative tasks such as EEG-based sentiment classification and zero-shot EEG → text → sentiment pipelines.

EEG-based Sentiment Analysis

Compared direct EEG-to-sentiment classification with text-mediated zero-shot approaches.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Elucidata AI Challenge 2025 (Kaggle)

Developed a CNN + Transformer hybrid model to predict spatial cell-type composition from histology images.

Processed large HDF5 datasets, extracted image patches, and generated competition-ready submissions.

Nature-Inspired Optimization for Classification

Implemented Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) to train neural networks.

Compared BFO against SGD and Random Search on MNIST with full statistical evaluation.

Computer Vision Projects

Cancer prediction using CNNs

Flower recognition and image classification pipelines

NLP Projects

Text summarization

Text translation

Classical Information Retrieval systems using Hugging Face and LLMs

Speech & Signal Processing

Distance-based speech recognition using FFT-based spectral features.

Frame-level signal processing and class-distance classification.
